# TerraZip
TerraZip is an integrated payment and collection framework for AI agents and developers, designed to enable machine-to-machine transactions and enhance interaction efficiency in the age of AI..
It reduces payment integration complexity by abstracting capabilities across platforms, and elevates "payment" to a fundamental capability that can be AI-driven, orchestrated, and verified.
